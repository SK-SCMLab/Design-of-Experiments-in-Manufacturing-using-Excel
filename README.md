# ðŸ‘¹ Design-of-Experiments-in-Manufacturing-using-Excel
This repository demonstrates key DoE concepts - applied to real-world manufacturing scenarios using Microsoft Excel. It includes:
1. Full factorial experimental design
2. Randomization
3. Blocking
4. Interaction analysis

## ðŸ¥± Design of Experiments (DoE)
- DoE is a one-stop method for analyzing all influencing factors simultaneously
- It is used when known sources of variation have been eliminated but process is still not capable, if process is capable then DoE may not be required
- It identifies which variable individually effect key measures
- It determines variable combinations or interactions that impact capability
- It provides mathematical model to predict and optimize the response or process output under recommended settings
- It is preferred on One Factor At a Time (OFAT) experiments because it allows for accelerated learning and is less-time consulting

|* DoE * | *Regression*|
|--------|-------------|
| 1. Determines Cause & Effect | 1. Uncovers relationships |
| 2. Tries bold (or) creative solutions | 2. Uses existing data |
| 3. Clears results on the impact variable | 3. Results left open to the interpretation |
| 4. Measures impact on variability | 4. Cannot measure variability impact | 
| 5. Provides reliable information on interactions | 5. Provides risky information on interactions |
| 6. Requires leadership support and investment | 6. Does not require leader |
